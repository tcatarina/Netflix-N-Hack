# Instructions

## Download image from [Releases](https://github.com/earthonion/Netflix-N-Hack/releases/latest)

### M.2 Drive Setup (PCIe Gen 4 NVMe)


> [!WARNING]
> This will wipe your M.2 drive.


**Disclaimer:** Only works on PS5s that have an activated account. Real PSN account or Fake activated via jailbreak.

**Do not update your console to activate!** Use System backup method below

#### Step 1: Download balenaEtcher
- Download **balenaEtcher** for Windows, macOS, or Linux from:
  [https://etcher.balena.io](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)

#### Step 2: Download the Image Archive
- Download the **`.7z` archive** for your desired capacity from the [**Releases** section.](https://github.com/earthonion/netflix-n-hack/releases)
  - NOTE: **Exact capacity matters** - not all 1TB drives are 1000GB: some are 1024GB, same with 2000/2048, 4000/4096; choose carefully!
- The `.7z` download size is roughly ~**95-100 MB** for all capacities.

#### Step 3: Extract the ZIP Image
- Extract the downloaded `.7z` file.
- Inside, you will see a `.zip` image file, with size depending on the target SSD:

  - **256 GB image:** ~**380 MB** `.zip`
  - **500 GB image:** ~**670 MB** `.zip`
  - **1 TB image:** ~**1.2 GB** `.zip`
  - **2 TB image:** ~**2.3 GB** `.zip`
  - **4 TB image:** ~**3.9 GB** `.zip`

  <ins>**This `.zip` is what you will flash with balenaEtcher.**</ins>

> **Note:** When you load this image in balenaEtcher, you may see a
> `Missing partition table` warning. This is expected for encrypted PS5 drives.
> It is safe to click **Continue**.

#### Step 4: Write the Image with balenaEtcher
1. Connect your **M.2 SSD (PCIe Gen 4 NVMe)** to your computer (using a dock/enclosure or spare M.2 slot).
2. Open **balenaEtcher**.
3. Click **“Flash from file”** and select the extracted **`.zip`** image for your chosen capacity.
4. Click **“Select target”** and choose your **M.2 SSD**.
5. Click **“Flash!”** to start the process.

> Approximate flashing times (varies depending on M.2 dock/enclosure speed and your CPU):
> - **256 GB image:** ~**10 minutes**
> - **500 GB image:** ~**15 minutes**
> - **1 TB image:** ~**25 minutes**
> - **2 TB image:** ~**45 minutes**
> - **4 TB image:** ~**80 minutes**
>
> Etcher will appear stuck at **0%** for a while, then at **85-99%** for several minutes.
> This is normal, let it finish without interruption!

#### Step 5: Install the M.2 Drive in the PS5
- Power off the PS5 completely.
- Install the imaged **M.2 SSD** into the PS5’s internal M.2 slot.
- Power the PS5 back on; the console should now see the preinstalled Netflix app, viewable under `Storage` settings.
- Move app from the M.2 to console storage, then reformat the M.2 drive in under `Storage` settings to safely continue using it.

### System Backup Restore

> [!WARNING]
> This will wipe all existing games and saves from your PS5!

#### Step 1: Prepare the Backup USB
1. Format a USB drive as **exFAT** or **FAT32**.
2. Unzip the **system backup** onto the formatted USB drive.

#### Step 2: Restore the System
Follow Sony’s official guide to restore your PS5 system from the USB:

# How to run proxy locally

## Requirements

- Python (for `mitmproxy`)
- `mitmproxy` (`pip install mitmproxy`)

---

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# install mitmproxy
pip install mitmproxy

# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/earthonion/Netflix-N-Hack/
cd Netflix-N-Hack

# run mitmproxy with the provided script
mitmproxy -s proxy.py

```

Current script will trigger after the WebSocket for remote logging is initiated.

```bash
# install websockets
pip install websockets

# Generate Keys
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"

# run WebSocket server
python ws.py

```

### Network / Proxy Setup

On your PS5:

1. Go to Settings → Network.


2. Select Set Up Internet Connection and choose your connection type (Wi-Fi or LAN).


3. Use Automatic for DNS Settings and MTU Settings.


4. When prompted for Proxy Server, choose Use and enter:

- IP address: \<your local machine IP\>

- Port: 8080



5. Save settings and run Test Internet Connection (be ready to press it).

### Edit inject_elfldr_automated.js and inject.js:

```
const ip_script = "10.0.0.2"; // IP address of computer running mitmproxy.
const ip_script_port = 8080; //port which mitmproxy is running on

```

> Make sure your PC running mitmproxy is on the same network and reachable at the IP you entered.

### Open Netflix and wait. 


> [!NOTE]
> expect a crash (for now), but if you see elfldr listening on port 9021 you can send your elf payload. 

### if it fails reboot and try again
